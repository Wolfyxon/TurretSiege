# Turret Siege
Open source rougelike game where you are a turret surrounded by enemies. Longer you survive, the better you score.

> [!NOTE]  
> The 3DS version may not work under emulators. On real hardware it will most likely crash on the first run, but run successfully when restarted. This seems to be a LovePotion bug (or my 3DS is broken lol).
